# DewberryVRProjects
 
 Hello! Welcome to my project. This was created over at A&T during the summer 2021 semester. 
 I have three types of demos here:
1. Model viewing demos, of models brought over from other applications (Blender, Paraview, OusterStudio) 
2. Physics demos, where I created some demos of VR physics interactivity when learning Unity
3. 3d Graph viewing demos, where I brought over .csv files and recreated them in Unity. 
4. Abandoned demos, that I pretend don't exist. I even forgot to include them on the earlier line! 
 
 Requirements: SteamVR, and a useable VR headset. 
 It is possible to add non-vr functionality, but please note that this git was created with VR access in mind. If necessary, I can coach or assist people who want to implement my ideas in a non-VR environment.
